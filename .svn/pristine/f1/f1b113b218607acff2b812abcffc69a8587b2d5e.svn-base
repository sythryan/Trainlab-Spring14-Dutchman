package Cabs is

   pragma Elaborate_Body (Cabs);

   -- Cabs are the power sources that are connected to
   -- blocks of track to power the trains.

   -- Cab output to the blocks can be set to a
   -- given percentage of maximum output.

   -- Cabs have a limit on their settings.  Attempts to
   -- set a cab above its limit results in setting the
   -- cab to its limit.

   -- The limit of each cab is initially zero.
