with Dallee;  -- Low level driver for the Dallee sound units
package Sound is

   -- This package provides Bell and Horn operations
   --
   -- Dallee hardware provides three types of sounds:
   --
   --    Diesel horn
   --    Bell
   --    Prime Mover - eight notches (levels) of diesel engine sounds
   --
   -- This package includes only horn and bell operations.  The prime mover
   -- sounds are hardwired directly to the output of the cabs so that the
   -- engine sounds are proportional to the cab voltages.
   -- Toggle switches on the sound panel can disable the prime mover sounds.
   -- A disabled prime mover is set to the lowest notch regardless
   -- of cab voltage.

   -- The sound board can handle up to four Dallee sound units
   -- Only three sound units are currently installed

   --    it is only stopped by disabling it with a call to Bell_Off.
