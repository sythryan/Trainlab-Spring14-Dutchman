   -- This child package provides types and a procedure to determine the
   -- blocks and the turnouts beneath a train given the location of its
   -- locomotive and caboose.

   --                   at most Blocks.Max_Size blocks.

   --                  If Success then
   --                     Blocks is a list of blocks under the train and the
   --                        direction each block should be powered to move

   --                        Caboose to Loco.
   --                     Turnouts is a list of turnouts under the train and
   --                        the direction each turnout should be set.
   --                        The turnouts in this list are in no order.
   --                  Else
   --                      We were unable to locate the train.  Based on the
   --                      input, there are more blocks or turnouts under the
   --                      train than will fit on the lists.
   --                      Blocks and Turnouts are undefined.
