Check each cab is initialized to 0 volts
For each cab:
Set cab to max and check voltage (13.7 ~ 13.8)
Set cab to 50% and check voltage (~7)

Test speed limiting on Unit 1:
Set cab limit to 0, set cab at 50% and 100%, check output remains 0 volts
Set cab limit at 50%, set cab at 75%, voltage ~= 7
set cab limit at 50%, set cab at 25%, voltage ~= 3.5

Set cab limit higher than current level:
Set limit to 50
Set value to 50
Set limit to 100
Expected: cab value remains at 50
